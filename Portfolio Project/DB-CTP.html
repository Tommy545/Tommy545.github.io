            <h3>Discord Bot Capture the Flag Project</h3>
            <p class="p-PHP">For this project I used to play a game in my freetime that wasn't really that good. So I decided to make my own little mini game within it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>How it works</p>
            <p class="p-PHP">I've made a few commands to make this project work:</p>
            <p class="p-PHP">- .Map</p>
            <p class="p-PHP">- .Attack</p>
            <p class="p-PHP">- .Done</p>
            <br>
            <p>.Map:</p>
            <p class="p-PHP">This command shows you the map which gets updated everytime a point is captured by a different team or if I would want to reset them to all white.</p>
            <br>
            <p>.Attack</p>
            <p class="p-PHP">On this page you'd be able to see the families that have signed up for the foodbank and if you're a high enough rank you'd be able to add some, its accompanied with a search bar on the left that works with javascript AJAX to talk with the database via php.</p>
            <br>
            <p>.Done</p>
            <p class="p-PHP">This command would be used after using .Attack</p>
            <br>
            <p class="p-PHP">Closing Statement:<br><br> I really liked this project as I learned how to do stuff like link php and JavaScript. it was very educational.</p>
