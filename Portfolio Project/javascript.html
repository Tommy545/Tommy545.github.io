            <p class="p-JS">In this project I have first utilized the php knowledge I had obtained during the course, same would be for MYSQL as I used that to store data.</p>
            <br>
            <p>How it works</p>
            <p class="p-JS">The Website has a total of 4 pages which you can navigate to with the navigation balk, the home & contact pages would be designed and filled out by the customers request or a frontend dev which is why I kept it empty mostly. The agenda and admin pages were what I focused on.</p>
