            <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="p-H">This game was a school project and I found this idea quite cool, I've worked on this for a while, it was back when I was still being introduced to coding outside of Scratch and python.</p>
            <br>
            <p>How the game works</p>
            <p class="p-H">When you first enter you're met with this screen:</p>
            <br>
            <img src="pictures/TicTacToe_game.png" class="image-H">
            <p class="p-H">Like your traditional Tic Tac Toe you'd take turns placing your marks, the first to get 3 in a row wins and the game would end.</p>
            <p class="p-H">PS: I will probably redo this project in the near future since I have had a lot of help from my teachers since I did not yet understand how to start off making such a project. But its been around a year now and I feel like I've progressed a lot since.</p>
