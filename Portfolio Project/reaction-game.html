            <h3>Reaction Speed Game</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="p-J">This game was a school project and I found this idea quite cool, I've worked on this for a while, it was back when I was still being introduced to coding outside of Scratch and Python.</p>
            <br>
            <p>How the game works</p>
            <p class="p-J">when you first enter you will see this screen:</p>
            <br>
            <img src="pictures/Screenshot_10.png" class="image-J">
            <p class="p-J">Pressing on the cube will start off with two things: a timer and a sequence of cubes. Every time you press on a cube, a new one will spawn on the canvas at a random location. This will repeat till the timer reaches 10 seconds. Once it reaches its end, the game round is over, and a count of the number of cubes you've hit in that time frame will show along with a retry button.</p>
